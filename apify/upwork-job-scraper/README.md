## ‚ö° How It Works

### **Data Source**
This actor connects to our **live Upwork scraping API** that:
- Runs 24/7 with advanced bot detection evasion
- Bypasses Cloudflare protection automatically  
- Maintains fresh job data with real-time updates
- Uses residential proxies and human-like behavior

### **Retrieval Process**
1. **API Connection**: Connects to `upworkjobscraperapi.nahidhq.com`
2. **Authentication**: Uses secure API key authentication
3. **Data Fetch**: Retrieves up to your specified job limit
4. **Processing**: Transforms raw data into structured format
5. **Output**: Saves to Apify dataset with friendly UI

### **Data Freshness**
- Jobs are scraped continuously from Upwork
- API updates every few minutes with new postings
- You get the most recent jobs available at runtime
- Last updated timestamp included in API response

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance & Delays

### **Expected Runtime**
- **Small runs (1-50 jobs)**: 10-30 seconds
- **Medium runs (51-200 jobs)**: 30-60 seconds  
- **Large runs (201-1000 jobs)**: 1-3 minutes

### **Potential Delays**
- **API Response Time**: 2-10 seconds (depends on job count)
- **Data Processing**: ~0.1 seconds per job
- **Network Latency**: 1-5 seconds (geographic location)
- **Apify Platform**: 5-15 seconds (container startup)

### **Factors Affecting Speed**
- **Job Count**: More jobs = longer processing time
- **API Load**: High demand may cause slight delays
- **Data Complexity**: Rich job data takes time to process
- **Network Conditions**: Internet speed affects API calls
