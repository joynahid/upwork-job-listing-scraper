### Step 2: Make Your First API Call

Use your API key to fetch the latest job postings:

  "https://api.upworkjobsapi.com/jobs?limit=5&payment_verified=true"
```

### Step 3: Explore the Data

Each job includes rich information about the client, budget, requirements, and more:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "upwork-123456",
      "title": "Full-Stack Developer for E-commerce Platform",
      "description": "We need an experienced developer to build...",
      "budget": {
        "fixed_amount": 5000,
        "currency": "USD"
      },
      "buyer": {
        "payment_verified": true,
        "country": "US",
        "total_spent": 125000,
        "total_jobs_with_hires": 15
      },
      "posted_on": "2024-09-27T10:30:00Z",
      "skills": ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],
      "url": "https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01abc123"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

## 🔑 Authentication

Every API request requires your unique API key in the header:

```http
GET /jobs HTTP/1.1
Host: api.upworkjobsapi.com
X-API-KEY: your-api-key-here
```

**Keep your API key secure:**
- Never expose it in client-side code
- Store it as an environment variable
- Rotate it regularly for security
