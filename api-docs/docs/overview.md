# Welcome to Upwork Jobs API

Upwork Jobs API delivers a clean, structured feed of live Upwork demand so content creators, newsletter operators, and idea studios can uncover premium opportunities without manual scraping. Every response includes the context you need to turn briefs into headlines, segments, and monetisable leads.

## Designed for content-led growth

**Creator-first data**
- Structured job objects include budgets, buyer history, and skills so you can qualify promising stories at a glance.
- Ready-to-filter segments make it simple to cluster ideas for newsletters, podcasts, and social threads.

**Integrated workflow support**
- Native webhooks and field mappings help you plug the API into n8n, Zapier, Make (Integromat), and custom automations.
- Drop curated jobs into Discord and Telegram channels to keep communities and collaborators aligned.

**Reliable signal, zero noise**
- Spam and duplicates are removed before you ever see them.
- High-veracity buyer signals (spend, hires, activity) ensure your team only pursues briefs with real intent.

## What you receive with every request

- Verified client metadata (payment status, lifetime spend, hire counts)
- Detailed project scope, skills, and category tagging
- Timestamps for posting and client activity to help you prioritise coverage
- Budget clarity across fixed and hourly work
- Deduplicated IDs that stay stable across refreshes

## Built for your publishing stack

1. **Capture**: Stream curated jobs into Airtable, Notion, or Sheets via Zapier, n8n, or Make.
2. **Transform**: Enrich each brief with your heuristics or AI prompts using our consistent schema.
3. **Publish**: Send finished digests through Discord, Telegram, or your ESP with a fully automated pipeline.
